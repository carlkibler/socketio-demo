socketio-demo
=============

A collection of demos showing Django, Gevent, SocketIO, and Redis being used in simple, intermediate, and complex ways.

This collection is the result of a long learning process and the hope of making it easier for future interested
folks. The examples collected here are from many hours of scouring blogs, help from more expert colleagues, and long
afternoons of experimentation.
